#Design patterns
Notes from design patterns books and trainings

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Code should be closed to modification and open to extension
- Dependency inversion - dependency upon abstractions, not concrete classes
- Principle of Least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friends
- The Hollywood principle - Don't call us, we'll call you
- Single responsibility - a class should have only one reason to change
